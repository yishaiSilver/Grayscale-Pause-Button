# Grayscale-Pause-Button
More often than not, I find myself losing time to frivolous things like youtube and netflix (especially during quarantine; stay safe!). One digital well-being tool that I like using to combat this problem is the grayscale option on my computer and phone. However, I find that this option has its limitations because some tasks require color (looking at you, [Warlight](https://www.warzone.com/)) -- I'll have to disable it and then I'll forget to re-enable it. This module does that for me!

When I type 12021 (inspired by the error code on Apollo 11), this module will disable grayscale for 10 minutes and then re-enable it. You can download it and then have it run in the background by using [task scheduler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2Cr_YRQk7o&ab_channel=CedricYarish) with the following changes to the instructions provided:
- use pythonw instead of python (runs windowless)
- use "At log on" instead of "On a schedule"
- make sure to uncheck the "Stop task if it runs longer than: ..." under settings

I'm sure that there are ways that this can be improved, but I see it as nothing more than a 1-day project; I've got other stuff to do!

Lastly, credits to the [keyboard module](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard). It's awesome.
